<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Decode Morse Code Message] <a name="about-project"></a>

This project aims to create a Ruby script that can decode Morse code messages. The script includes methods for decoding Morse code characters, words, and messages. The primary goals are to ensure code reusability through method reuse and to provide an effective way of translating Morse code into plain text.


## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>
This project is built using Ruby, a dynamic, open-source programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. Ruby's elegant syntax and powerful features make it a popular choice among developers.

Visit the official [Ruby Website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) website to learn more about the language and its capabilities.

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
To begin using the Morse Code Decoder, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PabloBona/decode_morse_code_message.git
    ```
   ```sh
   cd decode-morse-code
    ```
2. Run the script to decode a Morse code message:

   ```sh
   ruby decode_morse_code.rb
   ```

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

This project is implemented using the Ruby programming language, known for its elegant syntax and flexibility. Ruby provides a suitable foundation for this Morse code decoding project due to its ease of use and string manipulation capabilities.

## Usage of Ruby

Ruby is used extensively throughout the project for various tasks, including:

- Implementing the decoding algorithms.
- Creating reusable methods for character, word, and message decoding.
- Manipulating strings and performing pattern matching.
- Executing the script to decode Morse code messages.

The project leverages Ruby's strengths to provide an efficient and user-friendly Morse code decoding solution.



### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

This Morse Code Decoder project offers several key features that enhance its functionality:

- **Character Decoding:**
  The project provides a method to decode individual Morse code characters, converting them into their corresponding uppercase alphabetic characters. This feature forms the foundation for decoding words and messages.

- **Code Reusability:**
  To ensure clean and efficient code, the project follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Methods are designed to be reusable, reducing redundancy and promoting maintainability.

- **Flexible Adaptation:**
  The script's modular structure facilitates future expansion or customization. Additional decoding methods or enhancements can be integrated seamlessly.

These key features collectively contribute to a versatile and effective Morse code decoding tool.

<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

- **[How do I decode a Morse code character using this project?]**

  To decode a Morse code character, use the `decode_char` method provided in the Ruby script. Pass the Morse code character as an argument to the method. For example:

  ```ruby
  decoded_char = decode_char(".-")
  puts "Decoded character: #{decoded_char}" # Output: "Decoded character: A"
